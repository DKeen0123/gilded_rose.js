# gilded_rose.js

## My approach

* read the full spec and figured out what the application was designed to do

* explored the two classes in the console to gain a greater understanding of the functionality

* wrote unit tests to cover all of the current functionality so that I could begin refactoring the code so that I know if I break core functionality
